# InfinitePaint
This project contains a minimal example of an infinite canvas note taking
application built for Huawei HarmonyOS devices. The implementation is
written in **ArkTS**, following a simple MVC structure and SOLID
principles. It demonstrates how to implement an infinite canvas view with
pan and zoom support on touch devices.

### Build

Use the HarmonyOS SDK tooling to build and deploy the `entry` module to a
tablet or phone. From the project root run:

```
hdc shell build entry
```

Replace `hdc` commands with the appropriate build commands from your
development environment.
